This repo does two functions:
Time Series Analysis:
a. It uses San Francisco 311 Call Metrics data by month to generate forecasts of the next 3 months (CallCenterPrediction.ipynb)
b. Does initial Data Exploration on this data using R
Used Car price prediction:
a. Uses kaggle data from two repositories, to predict Used car data in two steps.
Step 1 : Based on Make, Model, State, Mileage (uses subset of makes for better accuracy)
Step 2: Based on more features like Make, Style, Size, Transmission, City MPG, Engine HP.
b. Does initial Data exploration and Data Analysis (CarPricePredictionAnalysis.ipynb)
c. Does predictive modeling using various techniques, and lists RMSE values, feature importances, uses Grid search to 
update model parameters, k-fold CV, Deep Learning techniques, Error plots, and selects best set of features and model
